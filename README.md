## Features

-   **PokÃ©mon Data Integration:** Utilizes the PokeAPI to fetch and display real-time PokÃ©mon data. (Note: All data is from the PokeAPI, a publicly available resource.)
-   **Deck Builder:** Allows users to create and manage custom PokÃ©mon card decks.
-   **Game Menu:** Provides an interface for starting and managing game sessions.
-   **Battle Field:** Facilitates the gameplay experience.
-   **User Authentication:** Secure user registration and login with bcrypt password hashing.
-   **Session Management:** Robust session handling for secure access control.
-   **Serverless Architecture:** Designed for deployment in a serverless environment for potential web hosting.
-   **Logging and Monitoring:** Implements Winston and Morgan for detailed logging and monitoring.
-   **Security:** Includes Helmet for HTTP header security and rate limiting to prevent abuse.
-   **Data Storage:** Uses Supabase with PostgreSQL for reliable data storage.

    cd ..
    ```

4.  **Configure environment variables:**

    -   Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
    -   Add the following environment variables:

        ```
        PORT=<your_server_port>
        SESSION_SECRET=<your_session_secret>
        SUPABASE_URL=<your_supabase_url>
        SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<your_supabase_anon_key>
        FRONTEND_URL=<your_frontend_url>
        NODE_ENV=<production or development>
        ```

5.  **Run the server:**

## API Endpoints

- `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
- `POST /login`: Authenticates a user and starts a session.
- `POST /logout`: Logs out a user and destroys the session.
- `GET /check-auth`: Checks if a user is authenticated.
- `GET /pokemon/:name`: Retrieves PokÃ©mon data from PokeAPI or cache.
- `POST /decklist`: Saves a user's deck list.
- `GET /deckdisplay/:user`: Retrieves all deck lists for a user.
- `GET /decklist/:user/:name`: Retrieves a specific deck list for a user.
- `POST /result`: Saves battle results.
- `GET /results/:username`: Retrieves battle results for a user.

## Security

- **Password Hashing:** Uses bcrypt for secure password storage.
- **Session Management:** Secure session handling with express-session.
- **CORS:** Configured to allow requests from specified origins.
- **Helmet:** Implements various HTTP header security measures.
- **Rate Limiting:** Protects against abuse with rate limiting.
- **Input Validation:** Validates all user inputs to prevent vulnerabilities.

## Logging

- Uses Winston for structured logging.
- Uses Morgan for HTTP request logging.
- Logs are stored in `error.log` and `combined.log`.

## Deployment
